**INTERVIEW SCRIPT**

*Garry walks in and sits in the chair*

**Garry**: My name is Garry Newburg *pauses for effect* and I am a hacker

**Interviewer**: What do you mean when you say your are a hacker?

**Garry**: I specialise in OSINT to track down peoples data and information online

**Interviewer**: What is OSINT?

**Garry**: OSINT or open source intelligence is when hackers use publicly available or open source data to trace and track anything that relates to an entity, this could be names, accounts or even in some cases full personal details such as addresses and passwords.

**Interviewer**: So you are saying that peoples personal and private information is just sitting online for people like you to track down?

**Garry**: *chuckles* Oh yes definatley people are told never to share info online but hardly anyone knows how much of their personal lives are shown online whether that is in the posts they make on social media or data they have had stolen and leaked without their knowledge

**Interviewer**: How did you get started in this im assuming this wasnt always your choice?

**Garry**: No I initially wanted to work in the film industry but I met some people who introduced me into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking and it just spiralled from that.

**Interviewer**: You describe what you do as ethical hacking but invading peoples privacy doesnt seem very ethical to me.

**Garry**: Most people would probably agree with you on that but when it comes to hacking ethical just means we are the good guys, we are hacking to protect and to expose those with nefarious goals and not for our own illegitimate gains

**Interviewer**: so lets say someone is using a certain username to carry out a cyber attack you could take that and then start unwrapping who that criminal is?

**Garry**: exactly. in fact in one case i dealt with we had a low level threat actor using hijacked youtube channels to distribute malware, for a few frames in one of the videos the username of their computer was visible and it just happened to be their full name, using that we were able to trace it back as far as what primary and secondary schools they had gone to.

**Interviewer**: so from one name you were able to find exactly who it was?

**Garry**: yes

**Interviewer**: that's scary

**Garry**: that's life
